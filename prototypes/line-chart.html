          <h6>How could we know is the San Francisco Fire Department fully equipped to handle the multitude and wide range or emergencies that occur in San Francisco?</h6>
          <p>This is a common scenario in fire departments across the country. A resident has a fire or emergency medical situation and calls 9-1-1, call intake information is gathered, the tones go off, crews are dispatched, and firefighters turn out and arrive on scene to mitigate the situation.
            <strong>The response time</strong>, it is the most strightforward aspect to see how fast or slow does San Francisco Fire Department to handle emergencies.</p>

              <h6>Data ETL(Extract, Tranform and Load)</h6>
              <p><strong>Response Time: </strong> first we need to know the definition of response time: response time is the total amount of time it takes to respond to a request for service.
                In this senario, the response time is calculat the different between Received DtTm(date and time of call is received at the 911 Dispatch Center) and Respond DtTm(Date and time this unit acknowledges the dispatch and records that the unit is en route to the location of the call).
              </p>
              <p></strong>Arrive Time After Respond: </strong> we use On Scene DtTm(Date and time the unit records arriving to the location of the incident) and Resond DtTm(ate and time this unit acknowledges the dispatch and records that the unit is en route to the location of the call) to find out
                how many time to arrive.

                <ul>
                  <li>Average of responseTime ranges from 3.562 to 4.841 on this sheet.Average of ArriveTimeAfterResponse ranges from 4.460 to 5.760 on this sheet.</li>

              <h6>The StandardL: NFPA</h6>
              <p>How do fire departments accurately evaluate their response in respond time?</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1710">NFPA 1710: Standard for the Organization and Deployment of Fire Suppression Operations, Emergency Medical Operations, and Special Operations to the Public by Career Fire Departments</a></p>
              <p>The basic idea is that the arrival of an effective response force on scene in less than<strong> 8 minutes</strong> (performance metric in NFPA 1710).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6>visualization analysis</h6>
              <p>From this datalization, we could easily see that the average of respond time don't increase though the number of emgerencies increase yearly. Moreover, we could see the maximum of averge respond time
                is 4.841 mimutes and the maximum of arrive time is 5.760. The total effective response is pretty high.Fire department response times and force assembly times are pretty low, it is more likely sufficient resources have been deployed,
                which is associated with more positive outcomes from risk events.
              </p>
              <p>The relationship between deployment of resources, response time and positive outcomes is circular. If fire department response times and effective response force assembly times are low, it is more likely that sufficient resources have been deployed, which is associated with more positive outcomes from risk events. Conversely, if response times and effective response force assembly times are high, it is more likely that insufficient resources have been deployed, which is associated with more negative outcomes.</p>
